# ABSTRACT

Online Election System would have Candidate registration, document verification, auto-generated User ID and pass for candidate and Voters. Admin Login which will be handled by Election Commission .Candidate Login which will be handled By Candidate, Voters will get Unique ID and Password, Using which they can vote for a Candidate only once per Election. The project is beneficial for Election Commission, Voters as the can get to know the candidate background and choose wisely, and even for Candidate. The software system allows the Candidate to login in to their profiles and upload all their details including their previous milestone onto the system. The admin can check each Candidate details and verify the documents, only after verifying Candidate’s ID and Password will be generated, and can remove faulty accounts. The software system allows Voters to view a list of Candidates in their area. The admin has overall rights over the system and can moderate and delete any details not pertaining to Election Rules.

# GAP ANALYSIS


Throughout the polling process, the voting turnout must be secured from external interpretation. Any correlation between registered votes and voter identities inside the electoral structure shall be unknown .As the previous model is having some insecurity so that it can be hacked easily and change the number of voting’s. But here we have rectified it by giving some strong security code so as it cant be hacked. In the previous model there is no kind of exact vote counting and so we have coded here as it shows the correct counting’s.

# DEFINING OUR SYSTEM
By analyzing the both abstract and gap analysis we have concluded the online Election system. We have set our project as admin have rights to create elections, counting the votes, publishing results and logout the activity. In new election as soon as we enter the password and username the user has the rights to elect the candidate personally. And we have only limited form of electing members. Here user will have unique username and password so that as soon he press enter he needs to fill the year he is voting and the branch code and then he can elect the candidate needed for him. Duplication of vote is to be neglected and can ban any unwanted or illegal user id from the admin point of view. We can count the overall votes and voting percentage.

# COST and FEATURES and TIMELINE

Fast and easy way of conducting Election.

Voters can view background of each Candidate.

Candidate can present themselves against voters.

Admin can verify the documents and details of Candidate.

System Generated Unique ID and Password gives more Secure Logins.

Result will be out after 2 Hrs of Election.
